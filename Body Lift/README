These files are a frankenstien lead screw solution I came up with. I do not know the lead pitch since I don't know how to correctly create them in fusion360 but they are what I am trying at the moment. 

The 2.5mm lead is to use as a die to cut a blank lifting beam, the 2.4mm lead is to print as your actual lead screw.
