Most all original designs go Dale Rogers (@dale) when he created the Open Ispired Project. Many of the Boom designs originated for the Printed Inspire v1.5 thread and @fragmaster found here : https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2399740-DJI-Inspire-3D-Printable-Quadcopter-V1-5!. Many thanks to all in that thread for the work they have done and inspiring me to join @dale and OI.

The early OI contributers - @dale, @StanV, @whitedragOn, @FugBucker, @DarrenE, @ramochacon. All these gusys have thrown ideas out that have inspired me in one way or another.
