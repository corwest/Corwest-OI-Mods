Hello World

My name is Corey @corwest and this is my collection of files from the Open inspired Project. Please visit the Forums over at OI and become a member and contribute!

Printing

Conversion- I may add stl versions later on but until I do, these step/stp files must be converted to stl format for printing. any cad software can accomplish this. I use Autodesk 123D Design and Fusion360.

Printing - All these files have been designed to be printed at 100% scale, 50-100% infil depending on structural load.

Filament - These have also been designed to be used with a near-zero shrinkage filament. PETg is what I use and if you wish to use ABS or similar then scaling accordingly will need to be done to account for shrinkage.

Credits

Most all original designs go to Dale Rogers @Dale when he created the Open Ispired Project. Many of the Boom designs originated from the Printed Inspire v1.5 thread and @fragmaster, @helifrek. Many thanks to all in that thread for the work they have done and inspiring me to join @dale and OI. 

All of the early contributors of OI. @dale, @StanV, @WhitedragOn, @DarrenE, @FugBucker
