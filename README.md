# Corwest-s-OI-Mods

# Hello World

My name is Corey [@corwest](http://openinspired.org/user/corwest/) and this is my collection of files from the [Open inspired Project](http://openinspired.org/). Please visit the [Forums over at OI](http://openinspired.org/forum/) and become a member and contribute!

# Printing

**Conversion** - I may add stl versions later on but until I do, these step/stp files must be converted to stl format for printing. any cad software can accomplish this. I use Autodesk 123D Design and Fusion360.

**Printing** - All these files have been designed to be printed at 100% scale, 50-100% infil depending on structural load.

**Filament** - These have also been designed to be used with a near-zero shrinkage filament. PETg is what I use and if you wish to use ABS or similar then scaling accordingly will need to be done to account for shrinkage.

# Credits/Thanks

Most all original designs go to Dale Rogers [@Dale](http://openinspired.org/user/dale/) when he created the [Open Ispired Project](http://openinspired.org/). Many of the Boom designs originated from the [Printed Inspire v1.5 thread](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2399740-DJI-Inspire-3D-Printable-Quadcopter-V1-5!) and [@fragmaster](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=402700), [@helifrek](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=28470) and others. Many thanks to all in that thread for the work they have done and inspiring me to join @dale and OI.
