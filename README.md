Conversion- I may add stl versions later on but until I do, these step/stp files must be converted to stl format for printing. any cad software can accomplish this. I use Autodesk 123D Design and Fusion360.

Printing - All these files have been designed to be printed at 100% scale, 50-100% infil depending on structural load.

Filiment - These have also been designed to be used with a near-zero shrinkage filiment. PETg is what I use and if you wish to use ABS or similar then scaling accordingly will need to be done to account for shrinkage.
