Printing - All these files have been designed to be printed at 100% scale, 50-100% infil depending on structural load.

Filiment - These have also been designed to be used with a near-zero shrinkage filiment. PETg is what I use and if you wish to use ABS or similar then scaling accordingly will need to be done to account for shrinkage.
